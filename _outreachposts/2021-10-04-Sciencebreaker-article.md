This outreach ([article](https://www.thesciencebreaker.org/breaks/evolution-behaviour/equalizing-strength-among-sexes-sexual-fluidity-in-female-moles)), published in The ScienceBreaker partnert with Université of Genève, explores how female moles develop ovotestes—organs combining ovarian and testicular tissue. This unique adaptation boosts androgen production, granting females greater strength and competitiveness, traits usually associated with males. The research highlights how evolutionary pressures in subterranean environments shaped this remarkable feature, challenging traditional views of sexual differentiation.
