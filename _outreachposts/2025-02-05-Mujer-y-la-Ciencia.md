Today we celebrate the International Day of Women and Girls in Science, a reminder of the importance of fostering equality and inspiring future generations.

Fany participated in this year’s event by visiting IES Nervión, where she shared the exciting research projects we develop at the Centro Andaluz de Biología del Desarrollo (CABD).

Her visit helped bring science closer to students. Inspiring young minds, especially girls, to see themselves as future scientists is one of the most meaningful impacts we can make.
