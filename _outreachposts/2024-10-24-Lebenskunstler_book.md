For non German speakers: Remarkable: What animals can teach us about ourselves, the value of diversity, and saving the world” by Russ Hodge. We’re proud to share that Fany participated in writing two chapters of this book. Her contributions include:

Chapter 3: Female, male, everything in between, everything else
Chapter 4: A world made of sound, upside down

This book offers a fascinating perspective on diversity in nature and what it teaches us about our own world.
