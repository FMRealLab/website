We would like to express our sincere gratitude to our former colleague Ana Alessandra Monaco for featuring our recent paper on her blog. The article, Schindler, M., Feregrino, C., Aldrovandi, S. et al. Comparative single-cell analyses reveal evolutionary repurposing of a conserved gene programme in bat wing development. Nat Ecol Evol (2025). ([https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-025-02780-x](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-025-02780-x)).
Ana’s thoughtful post helps bring this research to a broader audience, and we truly appreciate her continued support and engagement with our work. Thank you, Ana, for sharing our findings and contributing to the scientific dialogue!
