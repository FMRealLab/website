We are excited to support the **CABD Gender Equality Commission** and the **CABD Crochet Group** in their fundraising party for migrant women's settlements in Huelva.

The fundraising aims to raise awareness and provide support for those living in harsh settlement conditions in Huelva. This initiative seeks to highlight the vulnerability of migrant workers facing severe social and labor rights violations. ([For more information](https://www.uhu.es/agriculturaysalud/proyectos))

At the event, funds were raised in exchange for "tapas" and desserts, as well as through two raffles: one for a beautiful scarf 🧣 and another for a fantastic air fryer. We participated in both, but sadly, number 83 definitely wasn’t on our side.

We sincerely thank the **CABD Gender Equality Commission** and the **CABD Crochet Group** for their incredible commitment to this vital initiative, their dedication to making a positive impact is truly inspiring 💜.
