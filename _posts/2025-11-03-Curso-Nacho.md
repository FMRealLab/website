Nacho participated in the [Principles of Evolution III](https://lifehub.csic.es/curso-poe-iii-principles-of-evolution-course-biology-through-time-organizational-levels/): Biology through Time and Organizational Levels course organized by LifeHUB (CSIC).

The course took place at the Doñana Biological Reserve, in Doñana National Park (Huelva, Spain), from 3 to 14 November 2025. During the course, Nacho attended lectures and discussions by researchers in evolutionary biology covering topics such as evolutionary processes across different timescales, levels of biological organization, and comparative perspectives across species. The program combined theoretical sessions with practical activities in a unique natural environment. 🏞️

As part of the program, Nacho gave a short presentation introducing his PhD thesis project, which was a valuable opportunity to receive feedback and discuss his research with both faculty and other participants. The course also provided him a great chance to meet other early-career researchers, exchange ideas, and build professional connections in a collaborative and interdisciplinary setting.
