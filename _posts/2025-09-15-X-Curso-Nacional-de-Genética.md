Rubén participated in the X Curso Nacional de Genética organized by Sociedad Española de Genética 🧬.

The course took place at La Cristalera in Miraflores de la Sierra ⛰️, Madrid. During this week, Rubén attended lectures by leading researchers on topics such as genome assembly and annotation, gene regulation, and transcription factor cooperation during development.
As part of the program, Rubén gave a flash talk presenting his project, which proved to be a valuable opportunity to receive feedback and engage in scientific discussion. The retreat also offered a great chance to meet other young researchers 👩‍⚕️👨‍⚕️, exchange experiences, and build connections in a collaborative environment.
