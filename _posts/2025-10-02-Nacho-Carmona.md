As part of the PhD program at Universidad Pablo de Olavide, an annual retreat brings together doctoral students to share their research progress and connect with peers. This year, the retreat was held in the beautiful city of Carmona, where Nacho had the opportunity to present his work in poster format.

Of course, not everything was about science! Nacho and the other students also took the chance to explore the charming streets of Carmona 🌇!!
