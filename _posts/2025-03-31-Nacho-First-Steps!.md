Weâ€™ve got some exciting news from the lab today! 

Nacho has just produced his first-ever tetraploid blastocysts {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-dna" %} Looks like Nachoâ€™s got a solid start maybe heâ€™s hiding some secret lab techniques {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-user-ninja" %}


Weâ€™re hopeful these little blastocysts will lead to many, many embryos (fingers crossed ðŸ¤ž).
