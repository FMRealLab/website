ðŸŒŸ CABD at the Seville Science Fair! ðŸŒŸ

Nacho and RubÃ©n had the incredible opportunity to participate in the Seville Science Fair last week (April 22â€“24) as part of the CABD stand! They shared our research on decoding the evolutionary traits of moles, focusing on the unique adaptations of their limbs.

It was a fantastic opportunity to engage with the public and share the science behind mole evolution.
