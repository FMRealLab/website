We are thrilled to announce that Fany (Francisca Martínez Real), has been selected as one of the 28 new EMBO Young Investigators! 🎉

The EMBO Young Investigator Programme (YIP) is a prestigious initiative that supports outstanding young group leaders in the life sciences during the critical early stages of establishing their independent research careers. Selected investigators become part of an international network of excellence, gaining access to mentoring, leadership training, and opportunities for collaboration. The programme also provides financial support, annual funds for networking and travel, as well as access to EMBL core facilities. Being part of EMBO YIP is a mark of scientific distinction and a gateway to resources that foster innovation and leadership in research.
