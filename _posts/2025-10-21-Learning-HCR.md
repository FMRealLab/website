We are excited to share that we are currently training with Keren to master _In situ_ Hybridization Chain Reaction (HCR) 🔬.

**What is HCR?**
HCR is a _in situ_ hybridization method that allows to visualize the spatial distribution of gene expression directly within intact tissues. Unlike traditional methods, HCR uses a chain reaction of hybridization events to amplify the signal, providing high sensitivity and clear localization of target transcripts.
