# **Gene Regulation and Evolution**

What makes each species unique isn't just its genes, but how they're regulated. While only 2% of the genome codes for proteins, the remaining 98% shapes when, where, and how genes are expressed, driving the evolution of specialized traits. In our lab, we use the mole as a model to uncover how gene regulation sculpts adaptation, giving us a unique perspective on evolution—_through the eyes of a mole_.

We use genomics and omics approaches to explore classic _EvoDevo_ questions, combining them with synthetic biology to validate our findings in _in vivo_ models.

Moles have evolved a unique set of traits to survive in the harsh underground environment, including intersexual females, hypoxia resistance, and specialized limbs adapted for 'swimming' through soil. We investigate how these traits are encoded in their genome.

Our lab brings together a dynamic team of both experimental and computational members. This hybrid approach encourages teamwork, combining different perspectives to decode the complexities of mole evolutionary traits.
