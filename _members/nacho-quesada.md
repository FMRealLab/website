José Ignacio is a Ph.D. student at RealLab, where he began his doctoral research through the Spanish FPI predoctoral fellowship program. He holds a Bachelor's degree in Biology and completed a Master's in Biomedical Research in 2023, followed by a Master's in Physiology and Neuroscience in 2024 from the University of Seville. His research interests focus on understanding the mechanisms that govern gene expression and how alterations in these processes contribute to the divergence between closely related species. Additionally, he is passionate about learning omics data analysis to uncover insights for research and clinical applications.

Outside of academia, José Ignacio leads an active lifestyle, enjoying calisthenics and bouldering, as well as reading and meditating in the calm of nature. He also participates in environmental conservation through volunteer work, helping to release wild turtles back into their natural habitat along Andalusian beaches, thereby supporting the preservation of local wildlife.
