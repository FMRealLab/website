I am a Ph.D. student at RealLab, where I began my doctoral research with the support of the Spanish FPI predoctoral fellowship program. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Biology and completed a Master's in Biomedical Research in 2023, followed by a Master's in Physiology and Neuroscience in 2024 from the University of Seville. My research interests are focused on understanding the mechanisms that govern gene expression and how disruptions in these processes contribute to the divergence between closely related species. I am also passionate about learning omics data analysis to uncover valuable insights for both research and clinical applications.

Outside of my academic work, I lead an active lifestyle, enjoying calisthenics, bouldering, reading, and meditating in the peaceful surroundings of nature.
