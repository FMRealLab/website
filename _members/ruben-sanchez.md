I am a Ph.D. student in the Real Lab. I graduated from the Universidad de Córdoba (UCO) with a B.S. in Biochemistry in 2023, and then completed a Master's in Omic Data Analysis and Systems Biology at the Universidad de Sevilla (US) in 2024. My research interests focus on analyzing transcriptomic and epigenomic datasets to uncover the complex gene regulation mechanisms that drive gene expression.

Outside of the lab, I enjoy reading sci-fi and fantasy books and I am a video game enthusiast. I’ve explored a variety of sports, including boxing, hiking, padel, football, and climbing. I’m always looking for new challenges, stepping outside my comfort zone, and embracing opportunities to learn and grow.
