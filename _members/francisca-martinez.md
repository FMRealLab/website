My journey into the world of science began with a Biology degree, followed by a PhD in Genetics and Evolution at the University of Granada (Spain) in the lab of Prof. Rafael Jiménez. For my postdoctoral research, I moved to Germany and joined the lab of Prof. Stefan Mundlos at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics (MPIMG) in Berlin. During this time, we sequenced the genome of the Iberian mole at the chromosome-scale level, opening new possibilities for genomic studies in this iconic species. This work contributed to my promotion as a junior group leader at the MPIMG at the end of 2022. In 2023, I returned to Spain to establish my own hybrid research lab at the Andalusian Center for Developmental Biology (CABD), where we integrate experimental and computational biology to uncover how changes in the regulatory genome drive evolutionary adaptations. Our work bridges developmental biology, genomics, and evolutionary theory together with functional validations _in vivo_, pushing the boundaries of what we know about trait evolution.

Beyond science, I am a devoted mother of two and a strong advocate for work-life balance. Outside work, I enjoy spending time with my kids and finding moments of peace through yoga. I believe that balancing curiosity, family, and personal well-being is the key to both happiness and scientific creativity.
